## Mission Statement

<!-- Write a well-defined mission statement for the group for the 6 month period -->

### Mission Statement for the Innovation and Emerging Trends Working Group

This working group is dedicated to exploring and advancing the use of new technologies and strategies within developer relations (DevRel) practices. Our mission is to identify, evaluate, and share actionable strategies that empower DevRel professionals to adapt to emerging trends, optimize developer engagement, and embrace sustainable practices.

This group aims to:

1. **Explore AI in DevRel**: Investigate practical applications of AI in automation, development, onboarding, and community, enhancing both efficiency and developer satisfaction.
1. **Maintain Relevance**: Examine evolving industry trends to ensure DevRel strategies remain aligned with developers’ needs and expectations.
1. **Balance Sustainability and Reach**: Analyze the trade-offs between in-person and virtual engagement to propose sustainable practices without compromising impact or inclusivity.
1. **Evaluate Engagement Formats**: Compare the effectiveness of live versus asynchronous and virtual versus in-person interactions to inform best practices for developer engagement.

The group will operate transparently, leveraging its mailing list, Discord channel, and GitHub to encourage open participation, knowledge sharing, and collaboration among all stakeholders. Through this work, the group will contribute to the broader mission of the Developer Relations Foundation. 

## Expectations
